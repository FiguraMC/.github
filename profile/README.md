# The Figura Project


Us at FiguraMC are dedicated to re-imagining the way player customization in Minecraft works, as a way to allow players to more creatively express themselves. The goal is to achieve this in a purely client-side mod, using an external server to store and serve avatars, and to create a mod that enables users to easily create and customize interesting avatars that do not risk the safety or performance of other users..

Figura is specifically built to allow creators as much creative freedom as possible. This comes in the form of an easy-to-use creation pipeline, and a verbose, extensive Lua API for reading data from Minecraft and changing your avatar.
